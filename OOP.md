# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Cheat Sheet

## Principles

1. **Encapsulation**: Hides an object's internal state and functionality, only allowing access through a public set of functions.
1. **Abstraction**: Hides unnecessary implementation code, only revealing internal mechanisms that are relevant for other objects.
1. **Inheritance**: Allows classes to reuse code and properties from other classes.
1. **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to take on more than one form and share behaviors.
